# Summary

This was honestly a lot of fun. I really enjoy heroes and the comic universes so getting to play with an API that brings that together with coding was a lot of fun.

It doesn't mean that fun doesn't have its challenges however.

There were a lot of moving pieces with this project between the compnents and knowing what props to pass from one to the other and knowing how to do the appropriate dot-walking in the api to get the attributes I was looking to display was a struggle. I spent a lot of time doing console logs every step of the way with the data to make sure I was getting what was expected and addressing issues when I would get undefined. Tracking down why that was the case often led back to props that weren't passed correctly. I also, had an incredibly hard time wrestling against bootstrap and global css styling. They were often at odds with each other and there were times when it seemed I would never get that modal window to show where and how I wanted it to.

I had worked with modal windows before in small learning projects but that was always with vanilla javascript so bringin in those concepts and applying it to this project with useState and functions to apply the class of hidden on and off took some real thinking. Though it wasn't something that is really required for this app I thought it added a nice bt of fun, cause really who doesn't want to see these incredible characters drawn by incredibe artists??

Having more practice with multiple UseState variables and how to update those was good practice and being able to get more practice moving those from App down to the components is really starting to make a lot more sense which is fun to see happen and makes it apparent all the things that are possible using React as a development framework in full-stack development.
